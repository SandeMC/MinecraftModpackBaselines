## Why is ESSENTIAL not mentioned?
Simple reasons:
- It collects sensitive user data in the background;
- It's super intrusive in relation to the game;
- It promotes paid cosmetics;

### Then how do I play with my friends?
Multiple ways:
- Fund a hosted server for least amount of hassle.
- Ask one of your friends to host publicly and port forward (change the default port and use a whitelist if doing so);
- Use Tailscale or ZeroTier One (Hamachi but better and actually usable);
- Create a free Oracle Cloud account and host a minecraft server on their Flex instance (though their CPUs are pretty slow).
